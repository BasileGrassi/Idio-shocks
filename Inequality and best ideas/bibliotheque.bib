  abstract = {The current financial crisis has highlighted the changing role of
	financial institutions and the growing importance of the shadow banking
	system, which grew on the back of the securitization of assets and
	the integration of banking with capital market developments. This
	trend has been most pronounced in the United States but has had a
	profound influence on the global financial system as a whole. In
	a market-based financial system, banking and capital market developments
	are inseparable, and funding conditions are closely tied to the fluctuations
	in leverage of market-based financial intermediaries. Balance-sheet
	growth of market-based financial intermediaries provides a window
	on liquidity in the sense of the availability of credit, whereas
	financial crises tend to be associated with contractions of balance
	sheets. We describe the changing nature of financial intermediation
	in the market-based financial system, chart the course of the recent
	financial crisis, and outline the policy responses that have been
	implemented by the Federal Reserve and other central banks to counter
	it.},

	Euro Overnight Index Average (EONIA) and interbank market trading
	and assess the effectiveness of the ECB liquidity policy between
	07/2007 - 08/2008. We extend the model of [QM06] by (i) incorporating
	the microstructure of the EONIA market including the ECB fine-tuning
	operation on the last day of the maintenance period (MP) and banksâ€™
	daily excess liquidity, (ii) giving insight into banksâ€™ trading
	behavior characterized by an endogenous regime-switch and suggesting
	an efficient procedure to simulate the entire MP, and (iii) proposing
	a model for market distortion due to lending constraints which lead
	to a bid-ask spread for the EONIA rate. The model is calibrated by
	simulation fitting daily EONIA rates and aggregate liquidity measures
	observed between March 2004 and September 2008. Besides lending constraints
	we consider market segmentation and aggregate liquidity shocks as
	possible market distortions in the crisis period. For a calibration
	cross-check and for estimating the timing of the endogenous regime-switch
	we use panel data covering liquidity data of 82 Euro Area commercial
	banks for the period 03/2003 - 07/2007. With the calibrated model
	the ECB policy of liquidity frontloading is evaluated and compared
	with a reserve band system policy similar to the Bank of Englandâ€™s
	framework. We find that liquidity frontloading is a small scale central
	bank intervention which is capable of stabilizing interest rates
	in both frictionless and distorted markets. Simulations suggest that
	without frontloading the EONIA would have been, on average, 23 basis
	points above the policy rate (target); with frontloading, the overnight
	rate is, on average, on target. JEL Classification: E44, E52, G21.},

  abstract = {What is the impact of real estate prices on corporate investment?
	In the presence of financing frictions, firms use pledgeable assets
	as collateral to finance new projects. Through this collateral channel,
	shocks to the value of real estate can have a large impact on aggregate
	investment. Over the 1993-2007 period, the representative U.S. corporation
	invests 6 cents out of each additional dollar of collateral. To compute
	this sensitivity, we use local variations in real estate prices as
	shocks to the collateral value of firms that own real estate. We
	address the endogeneity of local real estate prices using the interaction
	of interest rates and local constraints on land supply as an instrument.
	We address the endogeneity of the decision to own land (1) by controlling
	for observable determinants of ownership and (2) by looking at the
	investment behavior of firms before and after they acquire land.
	The sensitivity of investment to collateral value is stronger the
	more likely a firm is to be credit constrained.},

  abstract = {Over the last thirty years, a new paradigm in banking theory has overturned
	economists' traditional vision of the banking sector. The asymmetric
	information model, extremely powerful in many areas of economic theory,
	has proven useful in banking theory both for explaining the role
	of banks in the economy and for pointing out structural weaknesses
	in the banking sector that may justify government intervention. In
	the past, banking courses in most doctoral programs in economics,
	business, or finance focused either on management or monetary issues
	and their macroeconomic consequences; a microeconomic theory of banking
	did not exist because the Arrow-Debreu general equilibrium model
	of complete contingent markets (the standard reference at the time)
	was unable to explain the role of banks in the economy. This text
	provides students with a guide to the microeconomic theory of banking
	that has emerged since then, examining the main issues and offering
	the necessary tools for understanding how they have been modeled.
	This second edition covers the recent dramatic developments in academic
	research on the microeconomics of banking, with a focus on four important
	topics: the theory of two-sided markets and its implications for
	the payment card industry; \&quot;non-price competition\&quot; and
	its effect on the competition-stability tradeoff and the entry of
	new banks; the transmission of monetary policy and the effect on
	the functioning of the credit market of capital requirements for
	banks; and the theoretical foundations of banking regulation, which
	have been clarified, although recent developments in risk modeling
	have not yet led to a significant parallel development of economic
	modeling.},

	explain an important part of aggregate shocks, and provide a microfoundation

	on using aggregate shocks to explain business cycles, arguing that
	individual firm shocks average out in aggregate. I show that this
	argument breaks down if the distribution of firm sizes is fat-tailed,
	as documented empirically. The idiosyncratic movements of the largest
	100 firms in the US appear to explain about one third of variations
	in output and the Solow residual. This \&quot;granular\&quot; hypothesis
	suggests new directions for macroeconomic research, in particular
	that macroeconomic questions can be clarified by looking at the behavior
	of large firms. This paper's ideas and analytical results may also
	be useful to think about the fluctuations of other economic aggregates,

	as reflected by bank-level information, matter for the transmission
	of monetary policy, while reconciling the micro and macro levels
	of analysis. We include factors summarizing large sets of individual
	bank balance sheet ratios in a standard factor-augmented vector autoregression
	model (FAVAR) of the French economy. We first find that factors extracted
	from banks' liquidity and leverage ratios predict macroeconomic fluctuations.
	This suggests a potential scope for macroprudential policies aimed
	at dampening the procyclical effects of adjustments in banks' balance
	sheets structure. However, we also find that fluctuations in bank
	ratio factors are largely irrelevant for the transmission of monetary
	shocks. Thus, there is little point monitoring the information contained
	in bank balance sheets, above the information already contained in
	credit aggregates, as far as monetary policy transmission is concerned.},

	changed the nature of financial intermediation in the United States
	profoundly. Within the market-based financial system, \&quot;shadow
	banks\&quot; are particularly important institutions. Shadow banks
	are financial intermediaries that conduct maturity, credit, and liquidity
	transformation without access to central bank liquidity or public
	sector credit guarantees. Examples of shadow banks include finance
	companies, asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits, limited-purpose
	finance companies, structured investment vehicles, credit hedge funds,
	money market mutual funds, securities lenders, and government-sponsored
	enterprises. ; Shadow banks are interconnected along a vertically
	integrated, long intermediation chain, which intermediates credit
	through a wide range of securitization and secured funding techniques
	such as ABCP, asset-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations,
	and repo. This intermediation chain binds shadow banks into a network,
	which is the shadow banking system. The shadow banking system rivals
	the traditional banking system in the intermediation of credit to
	households and businesses. Over the past decade, the shadow banking
	system provided sources of inexpensive funding for credit by converting
	opaque, risky, long-term assets into money-like and seemingly riskless
	short-term liabilities. Maturity and credit transformation in the
	shadow banking system thus contributed significantly to asset bubbles
	in residential and commercial real estate markets prior to the financial
	crisis. ; We document that the shadow banking system became severely
	strained during the financial crisis because, like traditional banks,
	shadow banks conduct credit, maturity, and liquidity transformation,
	but unlike traditional financial intermediaries, they lack access
	to public sources of liquidity, such as the Federal Reserve's discount

  abstract = {We formulate a version of the growth model in which production is
	carried out by heterogeneous establishments and calibrate it to U.S.
	data. In the context of this model we argue that differences in the
	allocation of resources across establishments that differ in productivity
	may be an important factor in accounting for cross-country differences
	in output per capita. In particular, we show that policies which
	create heterogeneity in the prices faced by individual producers
	can lead to sizeable decreases in output and measured total factor
	productivity (TFP) in the range of 30 to 50 percent. We show that
	these effects can result from policies that do not rely on aggregate
	capital accumulation or aggregate relative price differences. More
	generally, the model can be used to generate differences in capital
	accumulation, relative prices, and measured TFP. (Copyright: Elsevier)},

	economic topics, like the welfare effects of inflation, the relationship
	between money and capital accumulation, and the Phillips curve. We
	also extend the benchmark model in new ways, and show how it can
	be used to generate new insights in the study of payments, banking,

	Such estimates, however, may suffer from simultaneity and selection

	a semiparametric method that allows us to estimate the production
	function parameters consistently and thus obtain reliable productivity
	measures by controlling for such biases. This study first reviews
	this method and then introduces a Stata command to implement it.
	We show that when simultaneity and selection biases are not controlled
	for, the coefficients for the variable inputs are biased upward and
	the coefficients for the fixed inputs are biased downward. Copyright
